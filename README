This is CIS PDF Parser

This is give you a very good working copy of excel
The delimiter is "~"

Usage:
Create index.txt file containing the CIS index
Create all_text.txt containing all the CIS data . all_text.txt should not contain the indexes
use index_parse.py to generate index as list
copy paste the output list in one.py 
check one.py for releavent changes in headings and data

Known Bugs:
Sometimes the index may be screwed becuase its looking for (Scored) and (Not Scored) for determining next item. Please check if the all the index items you want to have has (Scored) or (Not Scored)
Eg. 1.1.1.1.2.31 has neither of (Scored) or (Not Scored). I have to manually add (Scored) in the index.txt  file to parse correctly

Also If one of the headings is not found then that cell of that particular heading gets botched up, however its easy to spot so just look at your excel
Eg. heading "Default Value" is missing in 1.2.3.3.2.3.1. See what happens in the final excel sheet
