1.1.1.1.1.1 Configure 'Deny log on through Terminal Services' (Not 
Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Terminal Services clients. After 
the baseline member server is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to use 
local accounts to access the server from the network. Domain accounts can access the 
server for administration and end-user processing. When configuring a user right in the 
SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in 
Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Any account with the right to log on through Terminal Services could be used to log on to 
the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users 
who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and 
run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

Assignment\Deny log on through Terminal Services 
Impact: 
If you assign the Deny log on through Terminal Services user right to other groups, you 
could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your 
environment. Accounts that have this user right will be unable to connect to the computer 
through either Terminal Services or Remote Assistance. You should confirm that delegated 
tasks will not be negatively impacted.

1.1.1.1.1.2 Set 'Allow log on locally' to 'Administrators, Users' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your 
environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence on 
the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on through 
Terminal Services or IIS also require this user right. The Guest account is assigned this user 
right by default. Although this account is disabled by default, it is recommended that you 
enable this setting through Group Policy. However, this user right should generally be 
restricted to the Administrators and Users groups. Assign this user right to the Backup 
Operators group if your organization requires that they have this capability. When 
configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can 
be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the console of the 
computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to 


23 | P a g e 

 

log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run 
malicious software to elevate their privileges.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Allow log on locally 
Impact: 
If you remove these default groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned 
to specific administrative roles in your environment. If you have installed optional 
components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services, you may need to assign 
Allow log on locally user right to additional accounts that are required by those 
components. IIS requires that this user right be assigned to the IUSR_<ComputerName> 
account. You should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected by any 
changes that you make to the Allow log on locally user rights assignments.

1.1.1.1.1.3 Set 'Debug programs' to 'Administrators' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger 
to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical 
operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do 
not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new 


24 | P a g e 

 

system components will need it. Note Microsoft released several security updates in 
October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the 
Debug programs user right. Administrators who did not have this user right were unable to 
install these security updates until they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical 
behavior for operating system updates. For more information, see Knowledge Base article 
830846: Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may use most or all the CPU 
resources. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of 
accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, 
users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information 
from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack 
tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security 
information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned 
only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability. The value of 
removing this user right from members of the Administrators group is diminished by the 
fact that a malicious user who has administrative privileges can bypass the 
countermeasure by launching processes under the Local System account. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed.  
Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to Administrators.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Debug programs 
Impact: 
If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. If you do revoke this 
privilege from all accounts and a problem arises that requires an application to be 
debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily 
and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU. The 
service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege; if it 
does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. For additional information about how to 
configure Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer hardening, see article 891597,

How to apply more restrictive security settings on a Windows Server 2003based cluster 
server, in the Microsoft Knowledge Base 
(http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100746). Tools that are used to manage 
processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the 
tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user 
right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start. Task Manager will 
not be able to manage processes owned by other accounts. Also, some older versions of 
Update.exe (which is used to install Windows product updates) require the account that 
applies the update to have this user right. If you install one of the patches that uses this 
version of Update.exe, the computer could become unresponsive. For more information, 
see article 830846, Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may use most or all 
the CPU resources, in the Microsoft Knowledge Base 
(http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100747).

1.1.1.1.1.4 Configure 'Log on as a service' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows accounts to launch network services or to register a process as a 
service running on the system. This user right should be restricted on any computer in a 
high security environment, but because many applications may require this privilege, it 
should be carefully evaluated and tested before configuring it in an enterprise 
environment. On Windows Vista based computers, no users or groups have this privilege 
by default. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of 
accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, 
users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Log on as a service is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch network 
services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is logged on to 


26 | P a g e 

 

the console. The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges 
can install and configure services. An attacker who has already attained that level of access 
could configure the service to run with the Local System account. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

Remediation: 
Configure the following Group Policy setting in a manner that is consistent with the 
security and operational requirements of your organization: 
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Log on as a service 
Impact: 
On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative impact. 
However, if you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need 
to assign the Log on as a service user right to additional accounts that are required by those 
components. IIS requires that this user right be explicitly granted to the ASPNET user 
account.

1.1.1.1.1.5 Set 'Perform volume maintenance tasks' to 'Administrators' 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows users to manage the system's volume or disk configuration, 
which could allow a user to delete a volume and cause data loss as well as a denial-of-
service condition. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of 


27 | P a g e 

 

accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, 
users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
A user who is assigned the Perform volume maintenance tasks user right could delete a 
volume, which could result in the loss of data or a denial of service (DoS) condition.

1.1.1.1.1.6 Set 'Bypass traverse checking' to 'Administrators, Users, 
Local Service, Network Service' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows users who do not have the Traverse Folder access permission to 
pass through folders when they browse an object path in the NTFS file system or the 
registry. This user right does not allow users to list the contents of a folder. When 


28 | P a g e 

 

configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can 
be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
The default configuration for the Bypass traverse checking setting is to allow all users, 
including the Everyone group, to bypass traverse checking. Permissions to files and folders 
are controlled though appropriate configuration of file system access control lists (ACLs), 
as the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any read or write permissions to the 
user. The only scenario in which the default configuration could lead to a mishap would be 
if the administrator who configures permissions does not understand how this policy 
setting works. For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to 
access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders. Such a situation is 
unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents little risk. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed.  
Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to Administrators, Users, Local Service, Network Service.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Bypass traverse checking 
Impact: 
The Windows operating systems, as well as many applications, were designed with the 
expectation that anyone who can legitimately access the computer will have this user right. 
Therefore, we recommend that you thoroughly test any changes to assignments of the 
Bypass traverse checking user right before you make such changes to production systems. 
In particular, IIS requires this user right to be assigned to the Network Service, Local 
Service, IIS_WPG, IUSR_<ComputerName>, and IWAM_<ComputerName> accounts. (It must 
also be assigned to the ASPNET account through its membership in the Users group.) We 
recommend that you leave this policy setting at its default configuration.

1.1.1.1.1.7 Configure 'Log on as a batch job' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows accounts to log on using the task scheduler service. Because the 
task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise 
environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to 
prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch 
malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer. When configuring a user right 
in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located 
in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most 
organizations, the default settings are sufficient. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed for your organization.  
Remediation: 
Configure the following Group Policy setting in a manner that is consistent with the 
security and operational requirements of your organization: 
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Log on as a batch job 
Impact: 
If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain based Group Policies, the 
computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled 
jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you 
might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those 
components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the IIS_WPG group 
and the IUSR_<ComputerName>, ASPNET, and IWAM_<ComputerName> accounts. If this 


30 | P a g e 

 

user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some 
COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality.

1.1.1.1.1.8 Configure 'Add workstations to domain' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to a specific 
domain. For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the 
Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right 
can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create 
Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can 
add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have 
been assigned the Add workstations to a domain user right. By default, all users in the 
Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active 
Directory domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers container. 
In Windows based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or 
computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources. 
In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the 
ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may 
want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can 
consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers 
to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could 
perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create 
additional unauthorized domain computers. When configuring a user right in the SCM 
enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active 
Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 


31 | P a g e 

 

The Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with 
this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates 
organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users 
to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could install Windows on his 
or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the 
password for the local administrator account, and could log on with that account and then 
add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights 
Assignment\Add workstations to domain 
Impact: 
For organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add 
them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed 
some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the 
organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward. It will not 
affect existing computers unless they are removed from and re-added to the domain.

1.1.1.1.1.9 Set 'Modify firmware environment values' to 'Administrators' 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


32 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting allows users to configure the system-wide environment variables that 
affect hardware configuration. This information is typically stored in the Last Known Good 
Configuration. Modification of these values and could lead to a hardware failure that would 
result in a denial of service condition. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a 
comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active 
Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Anyone who is assigned the Modify firmware environment values user right could 
configure the settings of a hardware component to cause it to fail, which could lead to data 
corruption or a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


33 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting allows users to change the Trusted for Delegation setting on a computer 
object in Active Directory. Abuse of this privilege could allow unauthorized users to 
impersonate other users on the network. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a 
comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active 
Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Misuse of the Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation user right 
could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network. An attacker 
could exploit this privilege to gain access to network resources and make it difficult to 
determine what has happened after a security incident.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


34 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer as 
a batch job. A batch job is not a batch (.bat) file, but rather a batch-queue facility. Accounts 
that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right. The Deny log on as a 
batch job user right overrides the Log on as a batch job user right, which could be used to 
allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an 
occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the 
recommended accounts can be a security risk. When configuring a user right in the SCM 
enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active 
Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale:

Impact: 
If you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right to other accounts, you could deny 
users who are assigned to specific administrative roles the ability to perform their required 
job activities. You should confirm that delegated tasks will not be affected adversely. For 
example, if you assign this user right to the IWAM_<ComputerName> account, the MSM 
Management Point will fail. On a newly installed computer that runs Windows Server 2003 
this account does not belong to the Guests group, but on a computer that was upgraded 
from Windows 2000 this account is a member of the Guests group. Therefore, it is 
important that you understand which accounts belong to any groups that you assign the 
Deny log on as a batch job user right.

1.1.1.1.1.12 Configure 'Deny log on as a service' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This security setting determines which service accounts are prevented from registering a 
process as a service. This policy setting supersedes the Log on as a service policy setting if 
an account is subject to both policies.  Note: This security setting does not apply to the 
System, Local Service, or Network Service accounts. When configuring a user right in the 
SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in 
Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Accounts that can log on as a service could be used to configure and start new 
unauthorized services, such as a keylogger or other malicious software. The benefit of the 
specified countermeasure is somewhat reduced by the fact that only users with 
administrative privileges can install and configure services, and an attacker who has

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum amount of memory that is available 
to a process. The ability to adjust memory quotas is useful for system tuning, but it can be 
abused. In the wrong hands, it could be used to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. 
Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or 
computers. 
Rationale: 
A user with the Adjust memory quotas for a process privilege can reduce the amount of 
memory that is available to any process, which could cause business-critical network 
applications to become slow or to fail. In the wrong hands, this privilege could be used to 
start a denial of service (DoS) attack.

Organizations that have not restricted users to roles with limited privileges will find it 
difficult to impose this countermeasure. Also, if you have installed optional components

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers in 
your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command. 
Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition. When configuring a user 
right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or 
located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
The ability to shut down domain controllers should be limited to a very small number of 
trusted administrators. Although the Shut down the system user right requires the ability 
to log on to the server, you should be very careful about which accounts and groups you 
allow to shut down a domain controller. When a domain controller is shut down, it is no 
longer available to process logons, serve Group Policy, and answer Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol (LDAP) queries. If you shut down domain controllers that possess Flexible 
SingleMaster Operations (FSMO) roles, you can disable key domain functionality, such as

1.1.1.1.1.16 Configure 'Back up files and directories' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up the 
system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP) attempts 
to access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application programming 
interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions apply. When 
configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can 
be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a non-
domain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the data. They 
could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is contained within 
the backup set.

1.1.1.1.1.17 Configure 'Restore files and directories' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other 
persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers 
that run Windows Vista in your environment. This user right also determines which users 
can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up files and 
directories user right. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited 
list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be 
groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 


41 | P a g e 

 

An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to 
a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important 
data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that 
are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include 
malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install 
backdoors for continued access to the computer. Note: Even if the following 
countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a 
domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations 
carefully protect the media that are used to back up data.

 Level 1 


42 | P a g e 

 

Description: 
This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys, processes,

Description: 
This policy setting allows users to use tools to view the performance of different system 
processes, which could be abused to allow attackers to determine a system's active

configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can 
be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
The Profile system performance user right poses a moderate vulnerability. Attackers with 
this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes 
that they might wish to attack directly. Attackers may also be able to determine what 
processes are active on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they 
may need to avoid, such as antivirus software or an intrusion detection system.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1

Description: 
This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide elevated 
rights to access sensitive data. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma 
delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they 
can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and can 
lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not assign 
any user accounts this right. The operating system examines a user's access token to 
determine the level of the user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the 
local computer or connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a 
privilege, the change is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's 
access token until the next time the user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to 
create or modify tokens can change the level of access for any currently logged on account. 
They could escalate their own privileges or create a denial of service (DoS) condition.

This policy setting determines whether users can increase the base priority class of a 
process. (It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority 
class.) This user right is not required by administrative tools that are supplied with the 
operating system but might be required by software development tools. When configuring 
a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either 
local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
A user who is assigned this user right could increase the scheduling priority of a process to 
Real-Time, which would leave little processing time for all other processes and could lead 
to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

 Level 1 
Description: 
This security setting determines which users are prevented from logging on at the 
computer. This policy setting supersedes the Allow log on locally policy setting if an 
account is subject to both policies.  Important: If you apply this security policy to the 
Everyone group, no one will be able to log on locally. When configuring a user right in the 
SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in 
Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Any account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of the

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is 
required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)based 
protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model 
Plus (COM+). When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of 
accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, 
users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target 
computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from the 
network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this 
user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone in the group will be able to read 
the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of 
recent versions of Windows, because the default share and NTFS permissions do not 
include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for 
computers that you upgrade from Windows NT® 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the 
default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default 
permissions in Windows Server 2003 and later versions of the Windows operating system.

initiating machine has this right, therefore it is recommended that it is assigned to the 
Users group. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet 
Information Services (IIS), you may need to assign this user right to additional accounts 
that are required by those components. It is important to verify that authorized users are 
assigned this user right for the computers they need to access the network.

 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the 
system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. If this user right is assigned, 
significant degradation of system performance can occur. When configuring a user right in 
the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in 
Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the network, 
which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In high security 
environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on a computer. 
Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network servers. When 
configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can 
be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.

Remote Assistance as part of its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user 
right through Group Policy. If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote 
Assistance, assign this user right only to the Administrators group or use the restricted 
groups feature to ensure that no user accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or 
another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is 
required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a 


55 | P a g e 

 

client to connect - for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes - to a 
service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the 
unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Services that are 
started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to 
their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured 
to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As 
a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started. Also, a user can 
impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist: . The access token that 
is being impersonated is for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the 
network with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level is less 
than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with the Impersonate a 
client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them 
connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of 
access to that of the client. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available to 
all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not 
have this user right. Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run 
under other users' sessions. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as 
application failure or data corruption. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a 
comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active 
Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. 
Rationale: 
Users who can create global objects could affect Windows services and processes that run 
under other user or system accounts. This capability could lead to a variety of problems,

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of 
non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the 
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need this 
user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows Management 
Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the Profile single process user right prevents intruders 
from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an attack on the system. 
When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. 
Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or 
computers. 
Rationale: 
The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker with 
this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical processes 
that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to determine what 
processes run on the computer so that they could identify countermeasures that they may

1.1.1.1.1.37 Set 'Change the system time' to 'Administrators' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the 
internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right 


63 | P a g e 

 

can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged 
events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred. When configuring 
a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either 
local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. Note: 
Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in 
your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which 
could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access 
domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is 
applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain 
controllers. 
Rationale: 
Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, 
time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders 
that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain 
may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from 
them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and 
authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, 
an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain 
or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain 
controllers, member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service 
automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways: . All client 
desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain controller as their 
inbound time partner. . All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain 
controller (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC 
emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their 
inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is 
authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this 
computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes 
much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the 
Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not 
accurate.

requirements' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing. 
Rationale: 
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an 
intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then 
forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a 
client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower 
the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong 
physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could 
implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which 


65 | P a g e 

 

performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man-
in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed for applications using the 
NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications 
that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication 
sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI. The 
possible values for the Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based 
(including secure RPC) servers setting are: . Require message confidentiality. This option is 
only available in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if 
encryption is not negotiated. Encryption converts data into a form that is not readable until 
decrypted. . Require message integrity. This option is only available in Windows XP and 
Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if message integrity is not negotiated. The 
integrity of a message can be assessed through message signing. Message signing proves 
that the message has not been tampered with; it attaches a cryptographic signature that 
identifies the sender and is a numeric representation of the contents of the message. . 
Require 128-bit encryption. The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) is not 
negotiated. . Require NTLMv2 session security. The connection will fail if the NTLMv2 
protocol is not negotiated. . Not Defined. 
Rationale: 
You can enable all of the options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that 
uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered 
with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. That is, these options help

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether digital certificates are processed when software 
restriction policies are enabled and a user or process attempts to run software with an .exe

policies rule). With software restriction policies, you can create a certificate rule that will 
allow or disallow the execution of Authenticode®-signed software, based on the digital 
certificate that is associated with the software. For certificate rules to take effect in 
software restriction policies, you must enable this policy setting.

1.1.1.1.2.5 Configure 'System cryptography: Force strong key protection

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether users' private keys (such as their S-MIME keys) 
require a password to be used. If you configure this policy setting so that users must 
provide a password - distinct from their domain password - every time that they use a key, 
then it will be more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored keys, even an attacker 
who discovers logon passwords. 
Rationale: 
If a user’s account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the 
malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources. You can 
configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct from 
their domain password every time they use a key. This configuration makes it more 
difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control 
of the user's computer and determines their logon password.

Impact: 
Users will have to enter their password every time they access a key that is stored on their 
computer. For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their e-mail they 
will be forced to enter the password for that certificate every time they send a signed e-
mail message. For some organizations the overhead that is involved using this 
configuration may be too high. For end user computers that are used to access sensitive 
data this setting could be set to "User is prompted when the key is first used," but Microsoft 
does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant impact on 
manageability. For example, if this setting is configured to "User is prompted when the key 
is first used" you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL 
certificates. More information is available in the Windows PKI blog:

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the 
domain member must be signed or encrypted. If a system is set to always encrypt or sign 
secure channel data, it cannot establish a secure channel with a domain controller that is 
not capable of signing or encrypting all secure channel traffic, because all secure channel 


72 | P a g e 

 

data must be signed and encrypted. Microsoft recommends to configure the Domain 
member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting to Enabled. 
Rationale: 
When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, 
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the 
domain controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the 
secure channel are authenticated - and sensitive information such as passwords are 
encrypted - but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted. If 
a computer is configured to always encrypt or sign secure channel data but the domain 
controller cannot sign or encrypt any portion of the secure channel data, the computer and 
domain controller cannot establish a secure channel. If the computer is configured to 
encrypt or sign secure channel data when possible, a secure channel can be established, but 
the level of encryption and signing is negotiated.

Options\Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) 
Impact: 
Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. 
The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the domain controller. 
However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of 
the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure 
channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless they have the Dsclient 
installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign 
secure channel data (always) setting on domain controllers that support Windows 98 
clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following: . The ability 
to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of Windows earlier 
than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of

enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and 
upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and domain controllers from trusted/trusting 
domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. You can enable the other two policy settings, 
Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible) and Domain

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with domain 
controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit) 
session key. To enable this policy setting, all domain controllers in the domain must be able 
to encrypt secure channel data with a strong key, which means all domain controllers must 
be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or later. If communication to non-Windows 
2000based domains is required, it is recommended that you disable this policy setting. 
Rationale: 
Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between domain 
controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in 
previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of 
these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks 
that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of

authentication to unlock workstation' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Logon information is required to unlock a locked computer. For domain accounts, the 
Interactive logon: Require Domain Controller authentication to unlock workstation setting 
determines whether it is necessary to contact a domain controller to unlock a computer. If 
you enable this setting, a domain controller must authenticate the domain account that is 
being used to unlock the computer. If you disable this setting, logon information 
confirmation with a domain controller is not required for a user to unlock the computer. 
However, if you configure the Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in 
case domain controller is not available) setting to a value that is greater than zero, then the 
user's cached credentials will be used to unlock the computer. Note: This setting applies to 
Windows 2000 computers, but it is not available through the Security Configuration 
Manager tools on these computers. 
Rationale: 
By default, the computer caches in memory the credentials of any users who are 
authenticated locally. The computer uses these cached credentials to authenticate anyone 
who attempts to unlock the console. When cached credentials are used, any changes that 
have recently been made to the account - such as user rights assignments, account lockout, 
or the account being disabled - are not considered or applied after the account is 
authenticated. User privileges are not updated, and (more importantly) disabled accounts 
are still able to unlock the console of the computer.

Impact: 
When the console on a computer is locked, either by a user or automatically by a screen 
saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if the user is able to re-authenticate to the 
domain controller. If no domain controller is available, then users cannot unlock their 
workstations. If you configure the Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache 
(in case domain controller is not available) setting to 0, users whose domain controllers are 
unavailable (such as mobile or remote users) will not be able to log on. 
Default Value:

1.1.1.1.2.10 Configure 'Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore 
privilege' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether to audit the use of all user privileges, including 
Backup and Restore, when the Audit privilege use setting is in effect. If you enable both 
policies, an audit event will be generated for every file that is backed up or restored. If the 
Audit: Audit the use of Backup and Restore privilege setting is enabled, a very large number 
of security events could quickly fill the Security event log. 
Rationale: 


78 | P a g e 

 

When back up and restore is used it creates a copy of the file system that is identical to the 
target of the backup. Making regular backups and restore volumes is an important part of a 
your incident response plan, but a malicious user could use a legitimate backup copy to get 
access to information or spoof a legitimate network resource to compromise your 
enterprise.

Impact: 
If you enable this policy setting, a large number of security events could be generated, 
which could cause servers to respond slowly and force the Security event log to record 
numerous events of little significance. If you increase the Security log size to reduce the 
chances of a system shutdown, an excessively large log file may affect system performance.

1.1.1.1.2.11 Set 'Accounts: Administrator account status' to 'Disabled' 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


79 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting enables or disables the Administrator account during normal operation. 
When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled, 
regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact when 
applied to the domain controller organizational unit via group policy because domain 
controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via 
group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings. 
Rationale: 
In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular 
schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to 
disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes 
to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be 
locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for 
brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known 
security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using 
the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the 
Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log 
on. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed.  
Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to 0.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Accounts: Administrator account status 
Impact: 
Maintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the Administrator 
account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the domain 
controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no other local 
Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the 
secure channel. If the current Administrator password does not meet the password 
requirements, you will not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is 
disabled. If this situation occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set the 
password on the Administrator account with the Local Users and Groups tool.

1.1.1.1.2.12 Set 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications 
(always)' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client 
component. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network client computer cannot 
communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to sign SMB 
packets. In mixed environments with legacy client computers, set this option to Disabled 
because these computers will not be able to authenticate or gain access to domain 
controllers. However, you can use this policy setting in Windows 2000 or later 
environments. Note When Windows Vista based computers have this policy setting enabled 
and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is 
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign 
communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see 
the Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related 
settings) section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. 
Rationale: 
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as 
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can 
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then forward them so that the 
server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the 
server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is 
the resource sharing protocol that is supported by the Windows operating systems. SMB 
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the 
authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) 
Impact: 
The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol 
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support 
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this 
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both 
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect 
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are 
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is 
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance 
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all 
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able 
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be 
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain 
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista 
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from 
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

Description: 
This policy setting determines what additional permissions are assigned for anonymous 
connections to the computer. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous Windows users 
are allowed to perform certain activities, such as enumerate the names of domain accounts

1.1.1.1.2.14 Set 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' to 
'Disabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log 
on. If you enable this policy setting, users can log on without this key combination. If you 
disable this policy setting, users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on to Windows 
unless they use a smart card for Windows logon. A smart card is a tamper-proof device that 
stores security information. 
Rationale: 
Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical 
impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press 
CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. 
If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of 
a trusted path. An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard 
Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be 
able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

1.1.1.1.2.17 Set 'Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data 
(when possible)' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate 
whether all secure channel traffic that it initiates must be digitally signed. Digital signatures 
protect the traffic from being modified by anyone who captures the data as it traverses the 
network. Microsoft recommends to configure the Domain member: Digitally sign secure 
channel data (when possible) setting to Enabled. 
Rationale: 


87 | P a g e 

 

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, 
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the 
domain controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the 
secure channel are authenticated - and sensitive information such as passwords are 
encrypted - but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted. If 
a computer is configured to always encrypt or sign secure channel data but the domain 
controller cannot sign or encrypt any portion of the secure channel data, the computer and 
domain controller cannot establish a secure channel. If the computer is configured to 
encrypt or sign secure channel data when possible, a secure channel can be established, but 
the level of encryption and signing is negotiated.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible) 
Impact: 
Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. 
The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the domain controller. 
However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of 
the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure 
channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless they have the Dsclient 
installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign 
secure channel data (always) setting on domain controllers that support Windows 98 
clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following: . The ability 
to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of Windows earlier 
than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of 
Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to 
authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a version of Windows 
earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain will be disabled. You can 
enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and

Rationale: 
In Active Directory based domains, each computer has an account and password just like 
every user. By default, the domain-joined computers automatically change their domain 
password every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that the

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer 
(TLS/SSL) Security Provider supports only the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher 
suite. Although this policy setting increases security, most public Web sites that are 
secured with TLS or SSL do not support these algorithms. Client computers that have this 
policy setting enabled will also be unable to connect to Terminal Services on servers that 
are not configured to use the FIPS compliant algorithms. Note If you enable this policy 
setting, computer performance will be slower because the 3DES process is performed on 
each block of data in the file three times. This policy setting should only be enabled if your 
organization is required to be FIPS compliant. Important: This setting is recorded in 
different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being used. For 
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 it is stored at 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy, with Windows Vista 
and later versions of Windows it is stored at 
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy\Enabled. This means

2003. However, when editing group policies or security templates which will be applied to 
computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 you must use Windows Vista 
or Windows Server 2008. 
Rationale: 
You can enable this policy setting to ensure that the computer will use the most powerful 
algorithms that are available for digital encryption, hashing and signing. Use of these 
algorithms will minimize the risk of compromise of digitally encrypted or signed data by an 
unauthorized user.

Impact: 
Client computers that have this policy setting enabled will be unable to communicate by 
means of digitally encrypted or signed protocols with servers that do not support these 
algorithms. Network clients that do not support these algorithms will not be able to use 
servers that require them for network communications. For example, many Apache-based 
Web servers are not configured to support TLS. If you enable this setting, you also need to 
configure Internet Explorer to use TLS. This policy setting also affects the encryption level 
that is used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The Remote Desktop Connection tool 
uses the RDP protocol to communicate with servers that run Terminal Services and client 
computers that are configured for remote control; RDP connections will fail if both 
computers are not configured to use the same encryption algorithms. To enable Internet 
Explore to use TLS 1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options. 2. Click

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using 
cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally 
to allow users to log on even if a domain controller cannot be contacted. This policy setting 
determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally. If 
this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker who is able to access 
the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force 
attack to determine user passwords. 
Rationale: 
The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose 
logon information the servers will cache locally. If the number is set to 10, then the server 
caches logon information for 10 users. When an eleventh user logs on to the computer, the 
server overwrites the oldest cached logon session. Users who access the server console will

Impact: 
Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no domain controller available to 
authenticate them. Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user 
computers, especially for mobile users. A configuration value of 2 means that the user's 
logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has 
recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance. This method allows 
users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's 
network.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 


94 | P a g e 

 

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its 
computer account password. If you enable this policy setting, the domain member will be 
prevented from changing its computer account password. If you disable this policy setting, 
the domain member can change its computer account password as specified by the Domain 
Member: Maximum machine account password age setting, which by default is every 30 
days. Computers that cannot automatically change their account passwords are potentially 
vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the password for the system's 
domain account. 
Rationale: 
The default configuration computers that belong to a domain is that they are automatically 
required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days. If you disable this 
policy setting, computers will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. 
Computers that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at 
risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain 
account.

1.1.1.1.2.23 Set 'Network access: Sharing and security model for local 
accounts' to 'Classic - local users authenticate as themselves' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are 
authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including 
the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The 
Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate 
as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource. 
Rationale: 
With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the 
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write 
access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase 
security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those 
computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for 
the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected. 
Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared 
system resources.

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether an anonymous user can request security identifier 
(SID) attributes for another user, or use a SID to obtain its corresponding user name. 
Disable this policy setting to prevent unauthenticated users from obtaining user names that 
are associated with their respective SIDs. 
Rationale: 
If this policy setting is enabled, a user with local access could use the well-known 
Administrator's SID to learn the real name of the built-in Administrator account, even if it 
has been renamed. That person could then use the account name to initiate a password 
guessing attack.

1.1.1.1.2.25 Configure 'MSS: (SynAttackProtect) Syn attack protection 
level (protects against DoS)' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This entry appears as MSS: (SynAttackProtect) Syn attack protection level (protects against 
DoS) in the SCE. This entry causes TCP to adjust retransmission of SYN-ACKs. When you 
configure this entry, the overhead of incomplete transmissions in a connect request (SYN) 
attack is reduced. You can use this entry to configure Windows to send router discovery 
messages as broadcasts instead of multicasts, as described in RFC 1256. By default, if 
router discovery is enabled, router discovery solicitations are sent to the all-routers 
multicast group (224.0.0.2). Not applicable to Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008. 
Rationale: 
In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server. 
The server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and is no longer 
able to respond to legitimate requests

Impact: 
This value adds more delays to connection indications, and TCP connection requests 
quickly time out when a SYN attack is in progress. If you configure this registry entry, the 
scalable windows and TCP parameters that are configured on each adapter (including 
Initial Round Trip Time (RTT) and window size), socket options no longer work. When the 
computer is attacked, the scalable windows (RFC 1323) and per adapter configured TCP 
parameters (Initial RTT, window size) options on any socket can no longer be enabled. The 
reasons these options cannot be enabled is because when protection is functioning, the 
route cache entry is not queried before the SYN-ACK is sent and the Winsock options are 
not available at this stage of the connection.

 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether members of the Server Operators group are 
allowed to submit jobs by means of the AT schedule facility. The impact of this policy 
setting configuration should be small for most organizations. Users, including those in the 
Server Operators group, will still be able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler

authenticates when they set up the job. Note: An AT Service Account can be modified to 
select a different account rather than the LOCAL SYSTEM account. To change the account, 
open System Tools, click Scheduled Tasks, and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT 
Service Account on the Advanced menu. 
Rationale: 
If you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of the 
AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service. By default, that 
is the local SYSTEM account. If you enable this policy setting, server operators could 
perform tasks that SYSTEM is able to do but that they would typically not be able to do, 
such as add their account to the local Administrators group.

1.1.1.1.2.29 Set 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' to 
'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft client/server software that allows users to 
link personal computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include 
transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. 
In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. 
However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will 
use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM 
version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows 
clients when they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate between 
Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains . Authenticate to computers 
that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP) . Authenticate to 
computers that are not in the domain The possible values for the Network security: LAN 
Manager authentication level setting are: . Send LM & NTLM responses . Send LM & NTLM 
â€” use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send NTLMv2 
responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2 responses 
only\refuse LM & NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN Manager authentication 
level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for 


103 | P a g e 

 

network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the 
session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that 
servers accept as follows: . Send LM & NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM 
authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, 
NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if 
negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if 
the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . 
Send NTLM response only. Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session 
security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 
authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and 
use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, 
NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use 
NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. 
Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). . Send 
NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM & NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and 
use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and 
NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These settings correspond to the levels 
discussed in other Microsoft documents as follows: . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response; 
never use NTLMv2 session security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never 
use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 
authentication. . Level 1 Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and 
NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain 
controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response 
only. Clients use only NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server 
supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3 
Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2 session 
security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 
authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM responses. Clients use NTLM 
authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain 
controllers refuse LM authentication, that is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 
Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use 
NTLMv2 authentication, use and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain 
controllers refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2). 
Rationale: 
In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server 
2003, and Windows XP clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM 
authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send 
LM). The default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use 


104 | P a g e 

 

their resources. However, this means that LM responses - the weakest form of 
authentication response - are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for 
attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 
95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 
protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these 
computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network 
authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, 
Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a 
secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier 
clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain 
will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 
domain controllers.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which registry paths and sub-paths will be accessible when 
an application or process references the WinReg key to determine access permissions. 
Note: In Windows XP this setting is called Network access: Remotely accessible registry 
paths, the setting with that same name in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and 
Windows Server 2003 does not exist in Windows XP. Note: When you configure this setting 
you specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used when entering the list is a line

Policy Editor's display pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the 
registry as a line-feed delimited list in a REG_MULTI_SZ value. 
Rationale: 
The registry contains sensitive computer configuration information that could be used by 
an attacker to facilitate unauthorized activities. The fact that the default ACLs assigned 
throughout the registry are fairly restrictive and help to protect the registry from access by 
unauthorized users reduces the risk of such an attack.

Description: 
This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must pass 
in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity. Administrators can 
use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an inactive SMB session. If

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting creates a default system access control list (SACL) for system objects 
such as mutexes (mutual exclusive), events, semaphores, and MS-DOS devices, and causes 
access to these system objects to be audited. If the Audit: Audit the access of global system 
objects setting is enabled, a very large number of security events could quickly fill the 
Security event log. 
Rationale: 
A globally visible named object, if incorrectly secured, could be acted upon by malicious 
software that knows the name of the object. For instance, if a synchronization object such 
as a mutex had a poorly chosen discretionary access control list (DACL), then malicious 
software could access that mutex by name and cause the program that created it to 
malfunction. However, the risk of such an occurrence is very low.

servers. Such an occurrence could cause servers to respond slowly and force the Security 
log to record numerous events of little significance. This policy setting can only be enabled 


110 | P a g e 

 

or disabled, and there is no way to choose which events are recorded. Even organizations 
that have the resources to analyze events that are generated by this policy setting would 
not likely have the source code or a description of what each named object is used for. 
Therefore, it is unlikely that many organizations could benefit by enabling this policy 
setting.

1.1.1.1.2.34 Set 'Shutdown: Clear virtual memory pagefile' to 'Disabled' 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the virtual memory pagefile is cleared when the 
system is shut down. When this policy setting is enabled, the system pagefile is cleared 
each time that the system shuts down properly. If you enable this security setting, the 
hibernation file (Hiberfil.sys) is zeroed out when hibernation is disabled on a portable 
computer system. It will take longer to shut down and restart the computer, and will be 
especially noticeable on computers with large paging files. 
Rationale: 
Important information that is kept in real memory may be written periodically to the page 
file to help Windows handle multitasking functions. An attacker who has physical access to 
a server that has been shut down could view the contents of the paging file. The attacker 
could move the system volume into a different computer and then analyze the contents of 
the paging file. Although this process is time consuming, it could expose data that is cached 
from random access memory (RAM) to the paging file. Caution: An attacker who has 
physical access to the server could bypass this countermeasure by simply unplugging the 
server from its power source.

Impact: 
It will take longer to shut down and restart the server, especially on servers with large 
paging files. For a server with 2 gigabytes (GB) of RAM and a 2-GB paging file, this policy 
setting could increase the shutdown process by 20 to 30 minutes, or more. For some 
organizations, this downtime violates their internal service level agreements. Therefore, 
use caution before you implement this countermeasure in your environment.

1.1.1.1.2.35 Set 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to 
console logon only' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can 
be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable 
this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the 
network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the 
keyboard of the computer. 
Rationale: 


112 | P a g e 

 

Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden 
through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default 
settings for Active Directory® domains require complex passwords of at least seven 
characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-
based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a 
user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank 
passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank 
passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected 
accounts could then use it to log on.

Description: 


113 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting determines what happens when an attempt is made to install a device 
driver (by means of Setup API) that has not been approved and signed by the Windows 
Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL). Depending on how you configure it, this policy setting will 
prevent the installation of unsigned drivers or warn the administrator that an unsigned 
driver is about to be installed. The Devices: Unsigned driver installation behavior setting 
can be used to prevent the installation of drivers that have not been certified to run on 
Windows Server 2003 with SP1. One potential problem with this configuration is that 
unattended installation scripts will fail when they attempt to install unsigned drivers. 
Rationale: 
This policy setting will not prevent a method that is used by some attack tools in which 
malicious .sys files are copied and registered to start as system services.

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the Administrators group or an object creator is the 
default owner of any system objects that are created. When system objects are created, the 
ownership will reflect which account created the object rather than the more generic 
Administrators group. 
Rationale: 
If you configure this policy setting to Administrators group, it will be impossible to hold 
individuals accountable for the creation of new system objects. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

Options\System objects: Default owner for objects created by members of the 
Administrators group 
Impact: 
When system objects are created, the ownership will reflect which account created the 
object instead of the more generic Administrators group. A consequence of this policy 
setting is that objects will become orphaned when user accounts are deleted. For example, 
when a member of the information technology group leaves, any objects that they created 
anywhere in the domain will have no owner. This situation could become an administrative 
burden as administrators have to manually take ownership of orphaned objects to update 
their permissions. This potential burden can be minimized if you can ensure that Full 
Control is always assigned to new objects for a domain group such as Domain Admins.

1.1.1.1.2.39 Set 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications 
(if server agrees)' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the SMB client will attempt to negotiate SMB packet 
signing. The implementation of digital signing in Windows based networks helps to prevent 
sessions from being hijacked. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network client 
will use signing only if the server with which it communicates accepts digitally signed 
communication. Microsoft recommends to enable The Microsoft network client: Digitally 
sign communications (if server agrees) setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB 
clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and 
servers in your environment. 
Rationale: 
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as 
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can 
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server 
might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or 
client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the 
resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB 
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the 
authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to 1.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) 
Impact: 
The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol 
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support 
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this 
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both 
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect 
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are 
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is 
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance 
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all 
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able 
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be 
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain 
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista 
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from 
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

Rationale: 
An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or 
someone who is able to connect to the server through Terminal Services) could view the 
name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which communication sessions, or pipes, will have attributes 
and permissions that allow anonymous access. Note: When you configure this setting you 
specify a list of one or more objects. The delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed 
or carriage return, that is, type the first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the 
next object, press Enter again, etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in 
group policy security templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group 
Policy Editor's display pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the 
registry as a line-feed delimited list in a REG_MULTI_SZ value. 
Rationale: 
You can restrict access over named pipes such as COMNAP and LOCATOR to help prevent 
unauthorized access to the network. The list of some of the default named pipes and their 
purpose is provided in the following list: Browser - Named pipe for the Computer Browser 
service. COMNAP - SNABase named pipe. Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is a 
collection of network protocols that were originally developed for IBM mainframe 
computers. COMNODE - SNA Server named pipe. EPMAPPER - End Point Mapper named 
pipe. LOCATOR - Remote Procedure Call Locator service named pipe. Lsarpc - Named pipe

Rationale: 
Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing 
the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for 


122 | P a g e

Impact: 
If you select Force Logoff, users will have to re-insert their smart cards and re-enter their 
PINs when they return to their workstations. Enforcing this setting on computers used by 
people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be 
frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a 
single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively 
manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at 
a time. For these reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on 
workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document

 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new

Note Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy 
setting is enabled. Also you will need to change the password on all accounts after you 
enable this setting. 
Rationale: 
The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password 
hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to 
impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of attacks 
will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more difficult for

SSP based (including secure RPC) clients' to 'Require message 
integrity,Require message confidentiality,Require NTLMv2 session 
security,Require 128-bit encryption' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed for applications using the 
NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications 
that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication 
sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI. The 
possible values for the Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based 
(including secure RPC) clients setting are: . Require message confidentiality. This option is 
only available in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if 
encryption is not negotiated. Encryption converts data into a form that is not readable until 
decrypted. . Require message integrity. This option is only available in Windows XP and 
Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if message integrity is not negotiated. The 
integrity of a message can be assessed through message signing. Message signing proves 
that the message has not been tampered with; it attaches a cryptographic signature that 
identifies the sender and is a numeric representation of the contents of the message. . 
Require 128-bit encryption. The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) is not 
negotiated. . Require NTLMv2 session security. The connection will fail if the NTLMv2 
protocol is not negotiated. . Not Defined. 
Rationale: 
You can enable all of the options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that 
uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered 
with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other words, these 
options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

In a SYN flood attack, the attacker sends a continuous stream of SYN packets to a server. 
The server leaves the half-open connections open until it is overwhelmed and no longer is 
able to respond to legitimate requests.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters:TcpMaxConnectRes
ponseRetransmissions 
Remediation: 
Configure the following Group Policy setting in a manner that is consistent with the 
security and operational requirements of your organization: 
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\MSS: (TcpMaxConnectResponseRetransmissions) SYN-ACK retransmissions when a 
connection request is not acknowledged 
Impact: 
If you configure this value to greater than or equal to 2, the stack will employ SYN-ATTACK 
protection internally. If you configure this entry to less than 2, the stack cannot read the 


128 | P a g e 

 

registry values at all for SYN-ATTACK protection. This entry shortens the default amount of 
time that is needed to clean up a half-open TCP connection. A site that is under heavy attack 
might set the value as low as 1. A value of 0 is also valid. However, if this parameter is set to 
0, SYN-ACKs will not be retransmitted at all and will time out in 3 seconds. If the value is 
this low, legitimate connection attempts from distant clients may fail. 
Default Value: 
3 seconds, half-open connections dropped after 9 seconds

1.1.1.1.2.48 Set 'Network access: Do not allow storage of credentials or 
.NET Passports for network authentication' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the Stored User Names and Passwords feature may 
save passwords or credentials for later use when it gains domain authentication. If you 
enable this policy setting, the Stored User Names and Passwords feature of Windows does 
not store passwords and credentials. 
Rationale: 
Passwords that are cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the computer. 
Although this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user unknowingly 
executes hostile code that reads the passwords and forwards them to another, 
unauthorized user.

to 1.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Network access: Do not allow storage of credentials or .NET Passports for 
network authentication 
Impact: 
Users will be forced to enter passwords whenever they log on to their Passport account or 
other network resources that aren't accessible to their domain account. Testing has shown 
that clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will be unable to connect to 
Distributed File System (DFS) shares in untrusted domains. Enabling this setting also 
makes it impossible to specify alternate credentials for scheduled tasks, this can cause a 
variety of problems. For example, some third party backup products will no longer work. 
This policy setting should have no impact on users who access network resources that are 
configured to allow access with their Active Directory based domain account.

1.1.1.1.2.49 Set 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign 
communications (always)' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines if the server side SMB service is required to perform SMB 
packet signing. Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream 
clients from using the workstation as a network server. 
Rationale: 
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as 
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can 
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and 
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker 


130 | P a g e 

 

could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized 
access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows 
operating systems.  SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the 
data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

prescribed. This group policy object is backed by the following registry location:

Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to 1.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) 
Impact: 
The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol 
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support 
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this 
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both 
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect 
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are 
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is 
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance 
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all 
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able 
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be 
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain 
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista 
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from 
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

1.1.1.1.2.51 Configure 'Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients 
when logon hours expire' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the local 
computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. It affects the SMB component. If 
you enable this policy setting, client sessions with the SMB service will be forcibly 
disconnected when the client's logon hours expire. If you disable this policy setting, 
established client sessions will be maintained after the client's logon hours expire. If you 
enable this policy setting you should also enable Network security: Force logoff when logon 
hours expire. If your organization configures logon hours for users, it makes sense to 
enable this policy setting. 
Rationale: 
If your organization configures logon hours for users, then it makes sense to enable this 
policy setting. Otherwise, users who should not have access to network resources outside 
of their logon hours may actually be able to continue to use those resources with sessions 
that were established during allowed hours.

Users will see a message in a dialog box before they can log on to the server console. Note 
that Windows XP and later versions of Windows support logon banners that can exceed

However, Windows 2000-based clients cannot interpret and display these messages. You 
must use a Windows 2000-based computer to create a logon message policy that applies to 
Windows 2000-based computers. If you inadvertently create a logon message policy on a 
Windows Vista-based or Windows XP Professional-based computer and you discover that 
it does not display properly on Windows 2000-based computers, do the following: Change

with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset when responses resume. 
The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the measured round-trip time on the

1.1.1.1.2.54 Set 'Accounts: Guest account status' to 'Disabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest 
account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system. Note that this 
setting will have no impact when applied to the domain controller organizational unit via 
group policy because domain controllers have no local account database. It can be 
configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password 
policy settings. 
Rationale: 
The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no 
password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the 
Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with 
permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone 
group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption 
of data. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list 
(DACL) for objects. The setting helps secure objects that can be located and shared among 
processes and its default configuration strengthens the DACL, because it allows users who 
are not administrators to read shared objects but does not allow them to modify any that 
they did not create. 
Rationale: 
This setting determines the strength of the default DACL for objects. Windows Server 2003 
maintains a global list of shared computer resources so that objects can be located and 
shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies 
who can access the objects and with what permissions. If you enable this setting, the 
default DACL is strengthened because non-administrator users are allowed to read shared 
objects but not modify shared objects that they did not create.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The 
program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could 
unleash malicious code on your computer network. To reduce the possibility of such an 
event, only administrators should be allowed to install printer drivers. However, because 
laptops are mobile devices, laptop users may occasionally need to install a printer driver 
from a remote source to continue their work. Therefore, this policy setting should be 
disabled for laptop users, but always enabled for desktop users. 
Rationale: 


139 | P a g e 

 

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on 
their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so 
on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the 
computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer 
drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install 
malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver.

Rationale: 
Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they

1.1.1.1.2.60 Set 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log 
security audits' to 'Disabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security 
events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 
and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit 
system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the 
system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When 
this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be 
logged for any reason. If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security 
audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. Therefore, this policy setting 
is configured to Not Defined for both of the environments that are discussed in this chapter. 
Rationale: 


144 | P a g e 

 

If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important 
troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, 
an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely 
force a computer shutdown.

Options\Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits 
Impact: 
If you enable this policy setting, the administrative burden can be significant, especially if 
you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events 
(clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator 
could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) 
vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with 
logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because 
the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, 
applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity 
when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for 
every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.

LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use ldap_simple_bind or 
ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a domain controller. The possible values for the 
Network security: LDAP client signing requirements setting are: . None . Negotiate signing . 
Require signature . Not Defined 
Rationale: 
Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder 
captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them 
to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a 
server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To 
lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to 
protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle 
attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means 
of IPsec authentication headers.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Microsoft recommends that you use this setting, if appropriate to your environment and 
your organization's business requirements, to help protect end user computers. This policy 
setting requires users to log on to a computer with a smart card. Note: This setting applies 
to Windows 2000 computers, but it is not available through the Security Configuration

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Interactive logon: Require smart card 
Impact: 
All users of a computer with this setting enabled will have to use smart cards to log onto 
the local computer, which means that the organization will need a reliable public key 
infrastructure (PKI) as well as smart cards and smart card readers for these users. These 
requirements are significant challenges, because expertise and resources are required to 
plan for and deploy these technologies. However, Windows Server 2003 and later versions 
of Windows Server includes Certificate Services, a highly advanced service for 
implementing and managing certificates. When Certificate Services is combined with client 
computers that run Windows, features such as automatic user and computer enrollment 
and renewal become available. For more information about deploying Smart Cards with 
Windows Vista see the paper "Windows Vista Smart Card Infrastructure" available for

1.1.1.1.2.63 Set 'System objects: Require case insensitivity for non-
Windows subsystems' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


148 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems. 
The Microsoft Win32® subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case 
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX 
(POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case 
sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX 
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label 
it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32 
tools, because only one of the files will be available. 
Rationale: 
Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity, 
failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to 
create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower 
case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such 
files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will be available.

Description: 
This policy setting determines how far in advance users are warned that their password 
will expire. It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to 14 days to 
sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire. 
Rationale: 
It is recommended that user passwords be configured to expire periodically. Users will 
need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be 
locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to 
confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to 
access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN) 
connections.

1.1.1.1.2.65 Set 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign 
communications (if client agrees)' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines if the server side SMB service is able to sign SMB packets if it 
is requested to do so by a client that attempts to establish a connection. If no signing 
request comes from the client, a connection will be allowed without a signature if the 
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled. 
Note Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully effective 
for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. 
Rationale: 
Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as 
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can 
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server 
might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or 
client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the 
resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB 
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the 
authentication process, data transmission will not take place. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed. This group policy object is backed by the following registry location: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters:enablesec

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security 
Options\Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) 
Impact: 
The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol 
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support 
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this 
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both 
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect 
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are 
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is 
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance 
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all 
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able 
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be 
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain 
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista 
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from 
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

screen saver is launched and when the console is actually locked automatically when 
screen saver locking is enabled. This setting is configured to 0 seconds for both of the 
environments that are discussed in this guide. 
Rationale: 
The default grace period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock 
takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period configuration, your 
computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from someone who could approach the console 
and attempt to log on to the computer before the lock takes effect. An entry to the registry

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether a computer can be shut down when a user is not 
logged on. If this policy setting is enabled, the shutdown command is available on the 
Windows logon screen. It is recommended to disable this policy setting to restrict the 
ability to shut down the computer to users with credentials on the system. 
Rationale: 
Users who can access the console locally could shut down the computer. Attackers could 
also walk to the local console and restart the server, which would cause a temporary denial 
of service (DoS) condition. Attackers could also shut down the server and leave all of its

Rationale: 
The Recovery Console can be very useful when you need to troubleshoot and repair 
computers that do not start. However, it is dangerous to allow automatic logon to the

1.1.1.1.3.1 Set 'Audit account logon events' to 'Success, Failure' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether to audit each instance of a user who logs on to or 
off from another computer that validates the account. Authentication of a domain user 
account on a domain controller generates an account logon event that is logged in the 
domain controller's Security log. Authentication of a local user on a local computer 
generates a logon event that is logged in the local Security log. No account logoff events are 
logged. The following table includes the important security events that this policy setting 
logs in the Security log. These event IDs can be useful when you want to create custom 
alerts to monitor any software suite, such as Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM). Table 
4.3 Account Logon Events Event ID Event description 672 An authentication service (AS) 
ticket was successfully issued and validated. In Windows Server 2003 with SP1, the type of 
this event will be Success Audit for successful requests or Failure Audit for failed requests. 
673 A ticket granting service (TGS) ticket was granted. A TGS is a ticket that is issued by the 
Kerberos version 5 TGS that allows a user to authenticate to a specific service in the 
domain. Windows Server 2003 with SP1 will log successes and failures for this event type. 
674 A security principal renewed an AS ticket or a TGS ticket. 675 Pre-authentication 
failed. This event is generated on a Key Distribution Center (KDC) when a user enters an 
incorrect password. 676 Authentication ticket request failed. This event is not generated by 
Windows Server 2003 with SP1. Other Windows versions use this event to indicate an 
authentication failure that was not due to incorrect credentials. 677 A TGS ticket was not 
granted. This event is not generated by Windows Server 2003 with SP1, which uses a 
failure audit event with ID 672 for this case. 678 An account was successfully mapped to a 
domain account. 681 Logon failure. A domain account logon was attempted. This event is 
only generated by domain controllers. 682 A user has reconnected to a disconnected 
Terminal Server session. 683 A user disconnected a Terminal Server session but did not log 
off.

Rationale: 
If audit settings are not configured, it can be difficult or impossible to determine what

are generated for all activities the Security log will be filled with data and hard to use. Also, 
you can use a large amount of data storage as well as adversely affect overall computer 
performance if you configure audit settings for a large number of objects. If failure auditing 
is used and the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits 
setting in the Security Options section of Group Policy is enabled, an attacker could 
generate millions of failure events such as logon failures in order to fill the Security log and 
force the computer to shut down, creating a Denial of Service. If security logs are allowed to 
be overwritten, an attacker can overwrite part or all of their activity by generating large 
numbers of events so that the evidence of their intrusion is overwritten.

This policy setting determines whether to audit user access to an Active Directory object 
that has its own specified system access control list (SACL). If you define the Audit 
directory service access setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, failures, or not 
audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when a user successfully 
accesses an Active Directory object that has a specified SACL. Failure audits generate an 
audit entry when a user unsuccessfully attempts to access an Active Directory object that 
has a specified SACL. If you enable the Audit directory service access setting in the DCBP

1.1.1.1.3.6 Set 'Audit account management' to 'Success, Failure' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines whether to audit each account management event on a 
computer. Examples of account management events include: . A user account or group is 
created, changed, or deleted. . A user account is renamed, disabled, or enabled. . A password 
is set or changed. Organizations need to be able to determine who creates, modifies, or 
deletes both domain and local accounts. Unauthorized changes could indicate mistaken 
changes made by an administrator who does not understand how to follow organizational 
policies, but could also indicate a deliberate attack. The following table includes the 
important security events that this policy setting records in the Security log. These event 
IDs can be useful when you want to create custom alerts to monitor any software suite, 
such as MOM. Most operational management software can be customized with scripts to 
capture or flag events that are based on these event IDs. Table 4.4 Account Management 
Events Event ID Event description 624 A user account was created. 627 A user password

created. 646 A computer account was changed. 647 A computer account was deleted. 648 A 
local security group with security disabled was created. Note: SECURITY_DISABLED in the 
formal name means that this group cannot be used to grant permissions in access checks. 
649 A local security group with security disabled was changed. 650 A member was added 
to a security-disabled local security group. 651 A member was removed from a security-

was set. Note: Every 60 minutes on a domain controller, a background thread searches all 
members of administrative groups (such as domain, enterprise, and schema 
administrators) and applies a fixed security descriptor on them. This event is logged. 685 
Name of an account was changed. 
Rationale: 
If audit settings are not configured, it can be difficult or impossible to determine what 
occurred during a security incident. However, if audit settings are configured so that events 
are generated for all activities the Security log will be filled with data and hard to use. Also, 
you can use a large amount of data storage as well as adversely affect overall computer 
performance if you configure audit settings for a large number of objects. If failure auditing 
is used and the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits 
setting in the Security Options section of Group Policy is enabled, an attacker could 
generate millions of failure events such as logon failures in order to fill the Security log and 
force the computer to shut down, creating a Denial of Service. If security logs are allowed to

be overwritten, an attacker can overwrite part or all of their activity by generating large 
numbers of events so that the evidence of their intrusion is overwritten.

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your

Impact: 
When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention 
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most 
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention 
method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this 
configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take 
advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous 
events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if 
you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored 
events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some 
other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an 
attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events 
are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about 
the attacker's activities.

1.1.1.2.12 Set 'Retention method for system log' to 'Overwrites events as 
needed' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


181 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting determines the wrapping method for the System log. It is imperative 
that the System log is archived regularly if historical events are desirable for either 
forensics or troubleshooting purposes. Overwriting events as needed ensures that the log 
always stores the most recent events, although this configuration could result in a loss of 
historical data. 
Rationale: 
If you significantly increase the number of objects to audit in your organization, there is a 
risk that the Security log will reach its capacity and force the computer to shut down. If 
such a shutdown occurs, the computer will be unusable until an administrator clears the 
Security log. To prevent such a shutdown, you can disable the Audit: Shut down system 
immediately if unable to log security audits setting that is described in Security Options 
and then increase the Security log size. If you set the Event log retention method to Manual 
or Overwrite events by days, it is possible for important recent events to not be recorded or 
for a DoS attack to occur.

To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to WhenNeeded.

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention 
method is set so that the computer can overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent 
ones.

If some services (such as the Security Accounts Manager) are disabled, you will not be able 
to restart the computer. If other critical services are disabled, the computer may not be 
able to authenticate with domain controllers. If you wish to disable some system services, 
you should test the changed settings on non-production computers before you change 
them in a production environment. It is also possible to alter the access control list (ACL) 
for a service, however do so with caution because unexpected results may arise. For 
example, changing the default permissions may cause enterprise management software to 
lose the ability to query the state of that service.

Any service or application is a potential point of attack. Therefore, you should disable or 
remove any unneeded services or executable files in your environment. There are 
additional optional services available in Windows that are not installed during a default 
installation of the operating system. Depending on the version of Windows you can add 
these optional services to an existing computer through Add/Remove Programs in Control

1.1.1.4.1 Password Policy 
1.1.1.4.1.1 Set 'Password must meet complexity requirements' to 
'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements 
for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following 
minimum requirements: . Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full 
name that exceed two consecutive characters . Be at least six characters in length . Contain 
characters from three of the following four categories: . English uppercase characters (A 
through Z) . English lowercase characters (a through z) . Base 10 digits (0 through 9) . Non-
alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) . A catch-all category of any Unicode 
character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be 
regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity 
exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would 
have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 
attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 
133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 
combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without 
punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) 
possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, 
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other 
special keyboard characters such as ! or @. Proper use of the password settings can help 
make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. 


238 | P a g e 

 

Rationale: 
Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with 
several publicly available tools.

Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to True.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password 
Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements 
Impact: 
If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for 
locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that 
contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the 
complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent 
security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the 
use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter 
might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that 
require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A 
custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed 
password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT 
key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, 
such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy 
help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all 
administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159 range. (ALT characters 
outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add 
additional complexity to the password.)

1.1.1.4.1.2 Set 'Minimum password length' to '14' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for 
a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best 
password length for an organization, but perhaps pass phrase is a better term than 
password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can 
include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a $5 milkshake is a valid pass 
phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random 
numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the 
proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. 
In enterprise environments, ensure that the value for the Minimum password length 
setting is configured to 8 characters. This policy setting is long enough to provide adequate 
security. In high security environments, configure the value to 12 characters. 
Rationale: 
Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words 
and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). 
Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to 
discover the accounts and passwords. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as 
prescribed. 
Remediation: 
To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to 14. 

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password 
Policy\Minimum password length 
Impact: 
Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an 
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If 
very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and 
increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten 


240 | P a g e 

 

passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass 
phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character 
combinations, much harder to discover. 
Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT® 4.0 do not 
support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older 
operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts 
that require long passwords.

1.1.1.4.1.3 Set 'Enforce password history' to '24' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be 
associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this 
policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 
0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the 
effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users 
from repeatedly changing their password. 
Rationale: 
The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can 
determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have 
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If 
password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually 
reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly 
reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the 
same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum 
password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse 
their original password.

To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to 24.  
Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password 
Policy\Enforce password history 
Impact: 
The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time 
they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords 
to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords 
somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create 
passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) 
to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for 
the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because 
users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently. 
Default Value: 
24 passwords remembered

1.1.1.4.1.4 Set 'Maximum password age' to '60' or less (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. 
Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the 
password will never expire. The default value for this policy setting is 42 days. 
Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the 
less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value 
is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users 
having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. 


242 | P a g e 

 

Rationale: 
The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a 
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user 
sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users 
are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a 
compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user is 
authorized access.

Impact: 
If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their 
passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, 
because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value 
for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced 
because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to 
use compromised accounts.

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way 
that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that 
require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are 
stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the 
passwords. 
Rationale: 
Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker 
format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system security.

Impact: 
If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or 
IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to 
Enabled. This setting is extremely dangerous to apply through Group Policy on a user-by-

 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before 
you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. 
(You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value 
for this setting is 0 days. 
Rationale: 
Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to 
remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. 
Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific 
individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old 
passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of 
security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history 
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce 
password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, 
they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they 
started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that 
is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 
for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

1.1.1.4.2 Account Lockout Policy 
1.1.1.4.2.1 Set 'Account lockout threshold' to '50' or less (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. 
Authorized users can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by 
remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged 
on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to 
authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock 
occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold 
to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which 
disables the account lockout feature. 
Because it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by 
triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should determine 
whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the risks you want to 
mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy setting. 
. Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be 
locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock out accounts in 
your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock 
themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a 
brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered: 
. A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more 
characters. 
. A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account 
lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for 
security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on 
the account at the time of the logon attempt. 
The second option is: 
. Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the 
ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force 
password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and 
reduce help desk calls, but will not prevent a DoS attack. 


246 | P a g e 

 

Rationale: 
Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions of password combinations for 
any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit the 
number of failed logons that can be performed. 
However, a denial of service (DoS) attack could be performed on a domain that has an 
account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series 
of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of attempts is 
greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every 
account. 
Audit: 
Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

to 50 or less. 

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Account 
Lockout Policy\Account lockout threshold 
Impact: 
If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an 
administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting will likely generate 
a number of additional help desk calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number 
of calls to the help desk in many organizations. 
If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by 
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure 
the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes. 
If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's 
attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a 
robust audit mechanism is not in place.

1.1.1.4.2.2 Set 'Reset account lockout counter after' to '15' or higher 
(Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold 
resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account lockout 
threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account 
lockout duration setting. 
If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that 
is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could 
maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, 
which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account 
lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time 
value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until 
all of the accounts are unlocked automatically. 
Rationale: 
Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password 
multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout 
counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the 
counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0.

Impact: 
If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is

248 | P a g e 

 

the preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after 
setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this 
policy setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after 
which their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the 
values used for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to expire 
before they call the help desk about their inability to log on.

1.1.1.4.2.3 Set 'Account lockout duration' to '15' or higher (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account is 
unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the number 
of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting 
is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator 
manually unlocks them. 
Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a 
high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk 
receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time 
a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have 
an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer. 
Rationale: 
A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout 
threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you configure the 
Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the specified number 
of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration setting to 0, then the 
account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it manually.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows Firewall opens TCP port 3389 for inbound 
connections. You must also specify the IP addresses or subnets from which these inbound 
messages are allowed. If you disable this policy setting, Windows Firewall blocks this port 
and prevents the computer from receiving Remote Desktop requests. If an administrator 
adds this port to a local port exceptions list in an attempt to open it, Windows Firewall does 
not open the port. Computers in your environment should accept Remote Desktop requests 
from as few computers as possible.

1.2.1.1.1.1.3 Configure 'Windows Firewall: Prohibit notifications' (Not 
Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Windows Firewall can display notifications to users when a program requests that 
Windows Firewall add the program to the program exceptions list. This situation occurs 
when programs attempt to open a port and are not allowed to do so because of current 
Windows Firewall rules. The Windows Firewall: Prohibit notifications setting determines 
whether these settings are shown to the users. If you configure this policy setting to 
Enabled, Windows Firewall prevents the display of these notifications. If you configure it to 
Disabled, Windows Firewall allows the display of these notifications. 
Rationale: 
Some organizations may prefer to avoid alarming users when firewall rules block certain 
types of network activity.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting helps prevent a computer from receiving unicast responses to its 
outgoing multicast or broadcast messages. 
Rationale: 
Typically, you would not want to receive unicast responses to multicast or broadcast 
messages. Such responses can indicate a denial of service (DoS) attack or an attempt to 
probe a known computer.

Impact: 
Note This policy setting has no effect if the unicast message is a response to a DHCP 
broadcast message that is sent by the computer. Windows Firewall always permits those 
DHCP responses. However, this policy setting can interfere with the NetBIOS messages that 
detect name conflicts.

administration exception' to 'Disabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Many organizations take advantage of remote computer administration in their daily 
operations. To provide flexibility for remote administration, the Windows Firewall: Allow 
inbound remote administration exception setting is available. If you enable this setting, 
computers in your environment should accept remote administration requests from as few 
computers as possible. To maximize the protection provided by Windows Firewall, make 
sure to specify only the necessary IP addresses and subnets of computers that are used for 
remote administration. 
Rationale: 
Some attacks have exploited the ports that are typically used by remote administration 
programs; Windows Firewall can help block these ports.

Impact: 


255 | P a g e 

 

If this policy setting is enabled, the computer can receive the unsolicited incoming 
messages that are associated with remote administration on TCP ports 135 and 445. This 
policy setting also allows Svchost.exe and Lsass.exe to receive unsolicited incoming 
messages and allows hosted services to open additional dynamically-assigned ports, 
typically in the range of 1024 to 1034 but potentially anywhere from 1024 to 65535. If you 
enable this policy setting, you need to specify the IP addresses or subnets from which these 
incoming messages are allowed. If you configure the Windows Firewall: Allow inbound 
remote administration exception setting to Disabled, Windows Firewall makes none of the 
described exceptions. The impact of configuring this policy setting to Disabled may be 
unacceptable to many organizations because many remote administration tools and tools 
that scan for vulnerabilities will fail.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting caused Windows Firewall to block all unsolicited incoming messages. It 
overrides all other Windows Firewall settings that allow such messages. If you enable this 
policy setting in the Windows Firewall item in Control Panel, the Don't allow exceptions 
check box is selected and administrators cannot clear it. 
Rationale: 
This policy setting provides a strong defense against external attackers and should be set to 
Enabled in situations in which you require complete protection from external attacks, such 
as the outbreak of a new network worm. If you set this policy setting to Disabled, Windows 
Firewall will be able to apply other policy settings that allow unsolicited incoming 
messages.

Many environments contain applications and services that must be allowed to receive 
inbound unsolicited communications as part of their normal operation. Such environments 
may need to configure the Windows Firewall: Do not allow exceptions setting to Disabled 
to allow those applications and services to run properly. However, before you configure 
this policy setting, you should test the environment to determine exactly what

Description: 
This policy setting creates an exception that allows file and printer sharing. It configures 
Windows Firewall to open UDP ports 137 and 138 and TCP ports 139 and 445. 
Rationale:

This policy setting defines the set of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message 
types that Windows Firewall allows. Utilities can use ICMP messages to determine the 


265 | P a g e 

 

status of other computers. For example, Ping uses the echo request message. If you 
configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Enabled, you must 
specify which ICMP message types Windows Firewall allows the computer to send or 
receive. When you configure this policy setting to Disabled, Windows Firewall blocks all 
unsolicited inbound ICMP message types and the listed outbound ICMP message types. As a 
result, utilities that rely on ICMP may fail. Many attacker tools take advantage of computers 
that accept ICMP message types and use these messages to mount a variety of attacks. 
However, some applications require some ICMP messages in order to function properly. 
Also, ICMP messages are used to estimate network performance when Group Policy is 
downloaded and processed; if ICMP messages are blocked, Group Policy may not be applied 
to affected systems. For that reason, it is recommended that you configure the Windows 
Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Disabled whenever possible. If your

exceptions setting. Note If any policy setting opens TCP port 445, Windows Firewall allows 
inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those sent by the Ping utility), even if the 
Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions policy setting would block them. Policy settings 
that can open TCP port 445 include Windows Firewall: Allow inbound file and printer 
sharing exception, Windows Firewall: Allow inbound remote administration exception, and 
Windows Firewall: Define inbound port exceptions.

1.2.1.1.1.2.5 Configure 'Windows Firewall: Define inbound program 
exceptions' (Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Some applications may need to open and use network ports that are not typically allowed 
by Windows Firewall. The Windows Firewall: Define inbound program exceptions setting 
allows you to view and change the program exceptions list that is defined by Group Policy. 
Rationale: 
There is risk that inbound exceptions will be made to programs that have software 
vulnerabilities, however, if exceptions are not allowed then management programs and 
other useful applications will fail.

Remediation: 
Configure the following Group Policy setting in a manner that is consistent with the 
security and operational requirements of your organization: 
Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Network Connections\Windows 
Firewall\Domain Profile\Windows Firewall: Define inbound program exceptions 
Impact: 
If this policy setting is Enabled you can view and change the program exceptions list. If you 
add a program to this list and set its status to Enabled, that program can receive unsolicited 
incoming messages on any port that it requests Windows Firewall to open, even if that port 
is blocked by another setting. If you configure this policy setting to Disabled, the program 
exceptions list that is defined by Group Policy is deleted. Note If you type an invalid 
definition string, Windows Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors. Because 
the entry is not checked, you can add programs that you have not installed yet. You can also

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Unless required by your environment and your organization's business requirements you 
may wish to avoid using this setting because the notifications can help users to understand 
why certain applications aren't working as expected. Windows Firewall can display 
notifications to users when a program requests that Windows Firewall add the program to 
the program exceptions list. This situation occurs when programs attempt to open a port 
and are not allowed to do so because of current Windows Firewall rules. The Windows 
Firewall: Prohibit notifications setting determines whether these settings are shown to the 
users. 
Rationale: 
Some organizations may prefer to avoid alarming users when firewall rules block certain 
types of network activity.

Description: 
This policy setting helps prevent a computer from receiving unicast responses to its 
outgoing multicast or broadcast messages. 
Rationale: 
Typically, you would not want to receive unicast responses to multicast or broadcast 
messages. Such responses can indicate a denial of service (DoS) attack or an attempt to 
probe a known computer.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Many organizations take advantage of remote computer administration in their daily 
operations. To provide flexibility for remote administration, the Windows Firewall: Allow 
inbound remote administration exception setting is available. If you enable this setting, 
computers in your environment should accept remote administration requests from as few 
computers as possible. To maximize the protection provided by Windows Firewall, make 
sure to specify only the necessary IP addresses and subnets of computers that are used for 
remote administration. 
Rationale: 
Some attacks have exploited the ports that are typically used by remote administration 
programs; Windows Firewall can help block these ports.

To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting 
to Disabled.  
Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network\Network Connections\Windows 
Firewall\Domain Profile\Windows Firewall: Allow inbound remote administration 
exception 
Impact: 
If this policy setting is enabled, the computer can receive the unsolicited incoming 
messages that are associated with remote administration on TCP ports 135 and 445. This 
policy setting also allows Svchost.exe and Lsass.exe to receive unsolicited incoming 
messages and allows hosted services to open additional dynamically-assigned ports, 
typically in the range of 1024 to 1034 but potentially anywhere from 1024 to 65535. If you 
enable this policy setting, you need to specify the IP addresses or subnets from which these 
incoming messages are allowed. If you configure the Windows Firewall: Allow inbound 
remote administration exception setting to Disabled, Windows Firewall makes none of the 
described exceptions. The impact of configuring this policy setting to Disabled may be 
unacceptable to many organizations because many remote administration tools and tools 
that scan for vulnerabilities will fail.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
Microsoft recommends that you avoid the use of this setting, unless required by your 
environment and your organization's business requirements. This policy setting caused 
Windows Firewall to block all unsolicited incoming messages. It overrides all other 
Windows Firewall settings that allow such messages. If you enable this policy setting in the 
Windows Firewall item in Control Panel, the Don't allow exceptions check box is selected 
and administrators cannot clear it. 
Rationale: 


275 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting provides a strong defense against external attackers and should be set to 
Enabled in situations in which you require complete protection from external attacks, such 
as the outbreak of a new network worm. If you set this policy setting to Disabled, Windows 
Firewall will be able to apply other policy settings that allow unsolicited incoming 
messages.

Many environments contain applications and services that must be allowed to receive 
inbound unsolicited communications as part of their normal operation. Such environments 
may need to configure the Windows Firewall: Do not allow exceptions setting to Disabled 
to allow those applications and services to run properly. However, before you configure

If you enable this policy setting, Windows Firewall opens TCP port 3389 for inbound 
connections. You must also specify the IP addresses or subnets from which these inbound 
messages are allowed. If you disable this policy setting, Windows Firewall blocks this port 
and prevents the computer from receiving Remote Desktop requests. If an administrator 
adds this port to a local port exceptions list in an attempt to open it, Windows Firewall does 
not open the port. Computers in your environment should accept Remote Desktop requests 
from as few computers as possible.

Description: 
This policy setting determines whether remote assistance may be solicited from computers 
running Windows operating systems in your environment. You can enable this policy 
setting to allow users to solicit remote assistance from IT expert administrators. If the 
Solicited Remote Assistance setting is enabled, the following options are available: . Allow 
helpers to remotely control the computer . Allow helpers to only view the computer Also, 
the following options are available to configure the amount of time that a user help request 
remains valid: . Maximum ticket time (value): . Maximum ticket time (units): hours, 
minutes or days When a ticket (help request) expires, the user must send another request 
before an expert can connect to the computer. If you disable the Solicited Remote 
Assistance setting, users cannot send help requests and the expert cannot connect to their 
computers. If the Solicited Remote Assistance setting is not configured, users can configure 
solicited remote assistance through the Control Panel. The following settings are enabled 
by default in the Control Panel: Solicited Remote Assistance, Buddy support, and Remote 
control. The value for the Maximum ticket time is set to 30 days. If this policy setting is 
disabled, no one will be able to access Windows Vista client computers across the network. 
Rationale: 
There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop 
session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it 
without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still 
choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must

configure Remote Assistance settings. If you enable this policy setting, you have two ways 
to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance: "Allow helpers to only view the computer" 
or "Allow helpers to remotely control the computer." The "Maximum ticket time" setting 
sets a limit on the amount of time that a Remote Assistance invitation created by using e-

1.2.2.4.1.2 Set 'Turn off Windows Update device driver searching' to

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting specifies whether Windows will search Windows Update for device 
drivers when no local drivers for a device are present. Note See also Turn off Windows 
Update device driver search prompt in Administrative Templates/System, which governs 
whether an administrator is prompted before Windows Update is searched for device 
drivers if a driver is not found locally. 
Rationale: 
If users are able to download and install device drivers there is a small chance that they 
will install a driver that reduces system stability. There is an even smaller possibility that 
they will install a driver that includes malicious code. These risks are very low because 
Microsoft requires vendors to test drivers extensively before they can be published on 
Windows Update.

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting determines the amount of time before previously scheduled Automatic 
Update installations will proceed after system startup. If you configure this policy setting to 
Enabled, a previously scheduled installation will begin after a specified number of minutes 
when you next start the computer. If you configure this policy setting to Disabled or Not 
configured, previously scheduled installations will occur during the next regularly 
scheduled installation time. Note: This policy setting only works when Automatic Updates 
is configured to perform scheduled update installations. If the Configure Automatic 
Updates setting is Disabled, the Reschedule Automatic Updates scheduled installations 
setting has no effect. You can enable the latter two settings to ensure that previously 
missed installations will be scheduled to install each time the computer restarts. 
Rationale: 
If Automatic Updates is not forced to wait a few minutes after a restart, computers in your 
environment might not have enough time to completely start all of their applications and 
services. If you specify enough time after a restart, new update installations should not 
conflict with the computer's startup procedures.

This policy setting specifies that Automatic Updates will wait for computers to be restarted 
by the users who are logged on to them to complete a scheduled installation. If you enable 
the No auto-restart for scheduled Automatic Updates installations setting, Automatic 
Updates does not restart computers automatically during scheduled installations. Instead, 
Automatic Updates notifies users to restart their computers to complete the installations. 
You should note that Automatic Updates will not be able to detect future updates until 
restarts occur on the affected computers. If you disable or do not configure this setting, 
Automatic Updates will notify users that their computers will automatically restart in 5 
minutes to complete the installations. The possible values for the No auto-restart for 
scheduled Automatic Updates installations setting are: . Enabled . Disabled . Not Configured

1.2.3.1.6 Configure 'Specify intranet Microsoft update service location' 
(Not Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows you to specify an intranet server to host updates from the 
Microsoft Update Web site. You can then use this update service location to automatically 
update computers on your network. The Automatic Updates client will search this service 
for updates that apply to the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet 
Microsoft update service location setting, you must set two server name values: the server 
from which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the server to 
which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values to be the same 
server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update service location setting, the 
Automatic Updates client will connect to the specified intranet Microsoft update service 
server (instead of Windows Update) to search for and download updates. This 
configuration allows end users in your organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides 
you with an opportunity to test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not 
configure this policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the 
Windows Update site on the Internet (if Automatic Updates is not disabled by Group Policy 
or user preference). 
Rationale: 
By default, Automatic Updates will attempt to download updates from the Microsoft 
Windows Update Web site. Some organizations want to verify that all new updates are 
compatible with their particular environment before they are deployed. Also, if you

309 | P a g e 

 

Directs Windows Installer to use system permissions when it installs any program on the 
system. This setting extends elevated privileges to all programs. These privileges are 
usually reserved for programs that have been assigned to the user (offered on the desktop), 
assigned to the computer (installed automatically), or made available in Add or Remove 
Programs in Control Panel. This setting lets users install programs that require access to 
directories that the user might not have permission to view or change, including directories 
on highly restricted computers. If you disable this setting or do not configure it, the system 
applies the current user's permissions when it installs programs that a system 
administrator does not distribute or offer. Note: This setting appears both in the Computer 
Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective, you must 
enable the setting in both folders. Caution: Skilled users can take advantage of the 
permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to 
restricted files and folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not

'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 


314 | P a g e 

 

This policy setting specifies whether Terminal Services always prompts the client 
computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a 
password prompt for users who log on to Terminal Services, even if they already provided 
the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client. By default, Terminal Services 
allows users to automatically log on if they enter a password in the Remote Desktop 
Connection client. The Always prompt client for password upon connection setting is 
configured to Enabled for both of the environments that are discussed in this guide. Note If 
you do not configure this policy setting, the local computer administrator can use the 
Terminal Services Configuration tool to either allow or prevent passwords from being 
automatically sent. 
Rationale: 
Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new 
Remote Desktop connection shortcut. If the server that runs Terminal Services allows users 
who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is 
possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could 
connect to a Terminal Server through the Remote Desktop connection shortcut, even 
though they may not know the user's password.

1.2.3.5 Windows Error Reporting 
1.2.3.5.1 Advanced Error Reporting Settings 
1.2.3.5.1.1 Set 'Report operating system errors' to 'Enabled' (Scored) 
Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting controls whether errors are reported. If you configure the Report Errors 
setting to Enabled, users have the ability to report errors when they occur. Errors can be 
reported to Microsoft through the Internet or to local file shares in the users' organizations. 
The possible values for the Report Errors setting are: . Enabled with options for: . Do not 
display links to any Microsoft provided more information Web sites. If you select this 
option, no links are displayed for Microsoft Web sites that may have more information 
about the error message. . Do not collect additional files. If you select this option, no 
additional files are collected to include in error reports. . Do not collect additional machine 
data. If you select this option, no additional information about the computer on which the 
error occurred is included in error reports. . Force queue mode for application errors. If 
you select this option, users do not have an option to send an error report. Instead, the 
error is placed in a queue directory, and the next administrator who logs on to the 
computer decides whether to report the error. . Corporate upload file path. You can select 
this option to specify a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to a file share where error 
reports are uploaded. This option also enables the Corporate Error Reporting tool. . 
Replace instances of the word Microsoft. If you select this option, you can customize the 
error reporting dialog boxes with your organization's name. . Disabled . Not Configured If 
you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot adjust the setting in the Control Panel. 
The default configuration is Enabled in Windows XP Professional and Disabled in Windows 
Server 2003. If the Report Errors setting is enabled, it will override any settings that are 
made through the Control Panel for error reporting. This configuration will also enforce the 
default values for any error reporting policies that are not configured. 


318 | P a g e 

 

Rationale: 
In its default configuration, the Windows Corporate Error Reporting features of Windows 
XP and Office will send data to Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep 
confidential. The Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting 
ensures that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows Corporate 
Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure this feature so that 
no information is transmitted outside of the organization without first being reviewed by a 
trusted member of the IT team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is 
more difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations that develop 
their own internal business applications can also take advantage of Windows Corporate 
Error Reporting to track down problems within their code. A reasonable configuration that 
ensures privacy and uses Windows Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your 
own internal Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to 
point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An administrator can then 
review the reports on the CER server and generate an aggregate report for Microsoft that 
contains no confidential information.

You can use this policy setting to control whether or not a user may report an error. When 
this policy setting is enabled, the user will be notified that an error has occurred and 
provided with access to details about the error. If the Report Errors setting is also enabled, 
the user will also be provided with a choice of whether to report the error. 
If you do not enable the Display Error Notification setting, the user is not provided with a 
choice of whether to report errors. If you enable the Report Errors setting errors will be 
automatically reported, but the user will not be notified when they occur. 
It is useful to disable this setting for server computers that do not have interactive users. If 
you do not configure this setting, users can adjust it through the Control Panel, which is set 
to Enable notification by default in Windows XP and Disable notification in Windows 
Server 2003.

the zone information is removed, users can open potentially dangerous file attachments 
that Windows has prevented users from opening. When the Hide mechanisms to remove 
zone information setting is enabled, Windows hides the check box and Unblock button. 
When this policy setting is disabled, Windows displays the check box and the Unblock 
button. Because dangerous attachments are often downloaded from untrusted Internet 
Explorer zones such as the Internet zone, it is recommended that you configure this policy 
setting to Enabled to help ensure that as much security information as possible is retained

Profile Applicability: 
 Level 1 
Description: 
This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments from 
Internet Explorer or Microsoft Outlook® Express with information about their zone of 
origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, or local). This policy setting requires that files 
be downloaded to NTFS disk partitions to function correctly. If zone information is not 
preserved, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments based on the zone where the 
attachment came from. If the Do not preserve zone information in file attachments setting 
is enabled, file attachments are not marked with their zone information. If this policy 
setting is disabled, Windows is forced to store file attachments with their zone information. 
Because dangerous attachments are often downloaded from untrusted Internet Explorer 
zones such as the Internet zone, it is recommended that you configure this policy setting to 
Disabled to help ensure that as much security information as possible is preserved with 
each file.
